### PROJECT TITLE
EXPLORING US BIKESHARE DATA WITH PYTHON

### Description
The purpose of this project is to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States- Chicago, Washington and New York City- using python. Motivate, a bike share company that opeartes in about 50 cities around the world, collected the data that was used for this project.

### FILES USED
*washington.csv: Shows the bike share data for Washington.

*new_york_city.csv: Shows the bike data for New York City.

*chicago.csv: Shows bike share data for Chicago.

*bikeshare.py: The Python script that imports the data, answers structured questions about it and creates an interactive experience in the terminal.


### REQUIREMENT
This program was written in Python (version 3.11.5) and relies on the following libraries:
*numpy python library

*pandas python library


### USAGE
First of all, you need to have python installed then you can run the project by opening a terminal window and navigating to the directory where the project files are located.

By typing the command **python bikeshare.py** the interactive session is initiated and specific information according to month, day of the week can be obtained.

### README.md
A basic understanding of Python is required to adequately use this project. It was designed to be interactive, thus answering questions such as:

*What is the average trip duration in a specific month?


*What is the most popular start station used on specific day of the week?


### CREDITS
The credit goes to **Udacity** for their **Introduction to Programming for Data Science** Nanodegree Program that has provided a powerful foundation to build. Also to **Motivate** who provided the data used for this course and most importantly, **ACCESS BANK** for making this available on scholarship.
